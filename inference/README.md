# Text Extraction Inference

This blueprint can be used to extract textual data from the pdfs containing handwritten as well as digital text. When documents are scanned and stored as pdfs, it becomes difficult to read or search the text stored in the them. We use a mixture of pdf extraction and ocr techniques in this blueprint that allows us to extract data from digital as well as scanned documents containing handwrriten text. In one click the user can retrieve all the text stored inside a pdf. **Note : Use this blueprint only if your pdfs contain handwritten text along with typed text or just handwritten text, as this blueprint takes more time to run as compared to text extraction blueprint** 

## Example curl command:

```
curl -X POST \
    https://text-extraction1-3-1.afbgghr4yqttu4sypilwvv.cloud.cnvrg.io/api/v1/endpoints/q8hyxheuixpxzu6apmxu \
-H 'Cnvrg-Api-Key: Cdvu4PPR9MQT3fZvWrF1oVHk' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-d '{"pdf": [pdf_1_base64_encoding, pdf_2_base64_encoding]}'
```
## Example output:

```
prediction :
{ 
    0 : 

    {
    
            0: "Text stored in page 1 of pdf 1"
            1: "Text stored in page 2 of pdf 1"
            2: "Text stored in page 3 of pdf 1"
    }

    1  :

    {
            0: "Text stored in page 1 of pdf 2"
            1: "Text stored in page 2 of pdf 2"
            2: "Text stored in page 3 of pdf 2"
    }
}
```
