You can use this blueprint to immediately extract text from your pdfs containing handwritten text. This blueprint works for scanned as well as digital pdfs. For using this pretrained Text Extraction model, you will need to create a ready-to-use API-endpoint that can be integrated with your data and application, in minutes. **Note : Use this blueprint only if your pdfs contain handwritten text along with typed text or just handwritten text, as this blueprint takes more time to run as compared to text extraction blueprint** 


1. Click on `Use Blueprint` button
2. In the pop up, choose the relevant compute you want to use to deploy your API endpoint
3. You will be redirected to your endpoint
4. You can now use the `Try it Live` section with any pdf.
5. You can now integrate your API with your code using the integration panel at the bottom of the page.
6. You will now have a functioning API endpoint that returns the text in pdfs!
